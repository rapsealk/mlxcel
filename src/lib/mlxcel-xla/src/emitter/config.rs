//! Emitter config for the dense architectures the OpenXLA backend serves.
//! The hard-coded [`Config::llama_3_2_1b`] matches spike/openxla/model_jax.py;
//! [`Config::from_json`] reads the same shape from a checkpoint's `config.json`.
//!
//! The config carries orthogonal architecture switches the emitter branches on,
//! so a new dense family is a combination of flags rather than a new code path:
//! the RoPE kind (llama3 vs plain, plus an optional per-layer local base for
//! Gemma3, an interleaved layout and a partial width for Cohere / StableLM),
//! whether q/k/v projections carry a bias (Qwen2), the LM-head tie, MLX
//! quantization, the Gemma embedding scale / `(1+w)` RMSNorm / GeGLU MLP, the
//! per-layer norm placement ([`NormStyle`]), an optional q/k normalization
//! ([`QkNorm`]: per-head for Qwen3 / Gemma3, flat for OLMo2 / OLMo3), the
//! sliding-window schedule (window + pattern period), and a per-layer NoPE mask
//! (SmolLM3). Llama / Qwen2 / Gemma2 keep their exact previous flag combinations,
//! so their emitted graphs are byte-for-byte unchanged.
//!
//! A second dense pack (issue #499) rides the same flags with a config / naming
//! delta and no new emit: Seed-OSS / MiMo (the Qwen2 bias forward), InternLM3
//! (plain / in-context `dynamic` RoPE), and ExaOne 3.x (llama3 RoPE with GPT-2-style
//! tensor names, selected by [`WeightScheme`]). A third pack (issue #498) adds the
//! per-family deltas the shared core needs for the parallel-block and norm-variant
//! families: a mean-subtract LayerNorm (with an optional affine bias), a parallel
//! attention + MLP block (Cohere/Cohere2), interleaved / partial RoPE, a dense
//! (non-gated) MLP (StarCoder2), the o_proj / MLP biases, and the Granite / MiniCPM
//! scalar multipliers, plus the Phi3 fused q/k/v and gate/up projections split at
//! load. Out-of-scope deltas an emit would get wrong (interleaved RoPE where the
//! family is not validated, an unsupported activation, yarn RoPE, MiniCPM3's MLA)
//! are rejected rather than mis-emitted.
